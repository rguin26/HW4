This package provides functions for linear least squares regression. It performs both ordinary least squares (OLS) and weighted least squares (WLS), and an option for including an intercept is provided for generating estimates of the beta coefficients, with an intercept included by default. The primary functions included in this package are:
  - `get_lin_least_sq_model`
  - `lin_least_squares_train_test`
